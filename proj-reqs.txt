API Link: https://opentdb.com/api_config.php

Hints
-----
- HTML entity -> decode it using he or html-entities

- Create a new array with all answers. Randomly insert the correct_answer into the array with the incorrect_answers. Use Google/ChatGPT for help on how to shuffle items in an array at random or how to insert an item randomly into an array.

- Limit answer choice to 1 and style selected answer: either--
    (1) track the selected answer index inside each question object
    (2) use an HTML form w/radio inputs using the same name attribute to automatically only allow one selection (and check Google on how to style a radio input to look like a button)
